# Steve is Tired
A game made by *these fine men*<sup>[1](https://github.com/SFR-git)[2](https://github.com/3174N)[3](https://github.com/g33king)[4](https://github.com/TEmadethemistakeofbeingongithub)</sup> for the [Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4).

## About the game
In *Steve is Tired*, you help Steve from accounting escape the office and his boss, who demands Steve work another shift.
Along the way, you find a can of *W◂◂RP Energy Drink*, which lets Steve go back to a recent point in time.
Move boxes, flip switches, and rewind your way to the exit!

This game consists of **$NUMBER** levels, and saves in the loading zone between them. 

## Play the game
This game was made with WebGL in mind, in order to submit it on itch.io. You can play it [here](https://sfr.moe/play).
With that in mind, if you want to install the game locally, you will find releases on the [releases page](https://github.com/SFR-git/4thmen-bj4/releases).
